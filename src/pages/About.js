        There we are. This painting comes right out of your heart. We'll put all
        the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. We'll do
        another happy little painting. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it
        make you happy. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over
        here.

        Have fun with it. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're
        doing the wrong thing. You have to make these big decisions. Let's go up
        in here, and start having some fun All you need is a dream in your
        heart, and an almighty knife. We have all at one time or another mixed
        some mud.

        Take your time. Speed will come later. Anytime you learn something your
        time and energy are not wasted. It's important to me that you're happy.
        Here's something that's fun.

        Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. I'm
        gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. We want to use a
        lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Just make a decision and
        let it go. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the
        way it should be.

        A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's what
        makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create
        the world that you want. Everything's not great in life, but we can
        still find beauty in it. A little happy sunlight shining through there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Isn't that fantastic? Work that paint. Just let go - and fall like a
        little waterfall.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is no right or wrong - as long as it makes you happy and doesn't
        hurt anyone. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. This is the time
        to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog
        around the house or taking it out on your spouse. You are only limited
        by your imagination.
